Description for part 1:
Part 1 works well as I expected. I have set up my page and you can run it using
this http://clac.cs.columbia.edu/~nai2110/cs3157/tng/

Description for part 2 a:
Part 2 works well as I expected. It serves as I hoped it would.

Description for part 2 b:
Part 2 b works well as I expected and servers mdb-lookup server. Took so many
days to get it to run appropriately though. All the status code are correctly
sent. However, it does have some still reachable memory which I couldn't control
and they vary depending on the status code.
